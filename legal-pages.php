                    Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American
                    Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a

                    legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baguette Marraine reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Site and the related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the
                    maximum extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of
                    Ohio and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Ohio in
                    all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized
                    in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including,

                    <br> 
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists

                    Baguette Marraine&#39;s performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal
                    process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of Baguette Marraine&#39;s
                    right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements
                    relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by Baguette
                    Marraine with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be
                    invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the
                    warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or
                    unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that
                    most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the

                    written, between the user and Baguette Marraine with respect to the Site. A printed
                    version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible
                    in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the
                    same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records
                    originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to the parties
